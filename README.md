# The uBlock Timeline of Mod's Server Banners

## About the Project

This is a, as complete as possible, (W.I.P) timeline of the events that lead to uBlock (and other ad blockers) blocking Server Hosting banners Modder's have on their mod pages.
This will be implemented into a website once enough of the main events have been documented.
The current version of the Timeline can be found here in [uBlock.md](uBlock.md).

### Formatting

#### Events

Events will be placed by date, the inclusion of any time stamps would be a great addition, but aren't required. If possible, please keep events in a chronological order, if you have to make a best estimate, please add a little note to the event.

#### Images

Images (or extra information such as videos) can be placed in `assets/YEAR.MO.DY/` of the event with a relevant name (using `snake_casing`) of the event its related to. e.g. `assets/2024.06.17/zephi_email.jpg`.
Imaged can be linked into the timeline by using the Markdown formatting, following this standard: `![image_description](assets/YEAR.MO.DY/image.name)`.
